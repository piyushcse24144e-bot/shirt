**Shirt - A Blockchain-Based Shirt Sales Smart Contract**

## 📜 Project Description
**Shirt** is a simple Ethereum smart contract that enables decentralized shirt sales directly on the blockchain.  
Customers can purchase shirts by sending Ether to the contract, and the contract owner can withdraw the funds securely once payments are made.  

This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can be used for **direct digital commerce** without intermediaries.

## 🧪 How to Use
1. Deploy the contract with your desired shirt price (in wei).  
   Example: `new Shirt(0.05 ether)`  
2. A customer calls `buyShirt()` and sends the exact Ether amount to purchase.  
3. The owner can later call `withdraw()` to collect sales revenue.  
4. Use `getBalance()` to view how much Ether is in the contract.
